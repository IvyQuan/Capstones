       <h2 class="title"> Why are Oceans Important?</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Oceans cover over 70% of the Earth's surface and are essential to the wellbeing of mankind, as well as any other living species on planet Earth. The ocean is appropriatly nicknamed "the lungs of planet Earth" because it contributes to over half of the world's oxygen and absorbs much of the carbon dioxide in the air. The ocean also makes up about 97% of all water on Earth. Many popular and common products and ingrediants are sourced from the ocean as well as important medicines and valuables.
