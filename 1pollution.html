    <h1 class="title"> About Ocean Pollution </h1>
    <p class="paragraph">Ocean pollution is one of, if not the most, serious threats that oceans face. Pollution from both man-made and natural sources is wreaking havoc on marine ecosystems all over the world. And the threat isn't limited to marine animals: the majority of pollutants that enter the water originate on land, according to the <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/ocean-coasts/ocean-pollution" target="_blank">National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration</a>. Animals often eat these pollutants which, means humans will as well.</p>

    <h2 class="title"> Effects of Ocean Pollution </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Both humans and animals are at risk from this waste. Fish get tangled up in the debris which inflict harm, and some animals mistake plastic waste for food and consume them. Small organisms eat microplastic, which is made up of microscopic fragments of broken-down plastic, and absorb the toxins from the plastic into their tissues. Microplastics have been found in a variety of marine species, including plankton and whales, with diameters of smaller than five millimeters (0.2 inches). When microplastic-eating microscopic organisms are consumed by larger animals, the hazardous compounds become ingrained in their tissues. Microplastic contamination thus migrates up the food chain, eventually becoming part of the food consumed by people; they even been found in bread.</p>

    <h2 class="title"> Solutions </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Over 90% of plastics are not recycled, simply recycling  alone isn't going to solve the problem. Problems  of this scale will only be resolved with a major change; that change is to completly reform in how corporations get their products to their customers. It is up to each of us to demand better, to warn these corporate behemoths that we will no longer put up with the plastics they force upon us; we must get rid of our obsession of single use plastic. Our planet deserves better, and we don't need their goods if they won't change. With enough pressure from our supporters and friends around the world, major corporations such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Starbucks, McDonald's, Unilever, Nestlé, and Procter & Gamble will embrace a more sustainable strategy through innovation and redesign. They'll abandon the old narrative and rediscover new ways to produce and distribute goods that respects our oceans and our planet.<a href="https://engage.us.greenpeace.org/onlineactions/gShqMDRqnEKzVTuFzHNMIQ2?utm_source=website&utm_medium=actioncard&utm_campaign=170823_Plastics_CEO_General&sourceid=202519&_ga=2.228210333.1897065951.1522681917-256365331.1516898767" target="_blank">Sign this petition</a> from greenpeace.org demanding that the CEOs of seven of the largest producers of single-use plastics take responsibility for their products. Join us in letting executives at Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestlé, Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Starbucks, McDonald’s, and others know that we no longer want products made with single-use plastic packaging.</p>
    
    <ul>Here are some other things you can do:</ul>
    <div id="solution_list"
     <li>Refuse plastic whenever possible. Say no to straws, lids, plastic bags, and plastic takeaway containers. Carry your own utensils or a wooden spork and avoid using plastic utensils.</li>
     <li>Review restaurants and cafes and recognize them when they avoid straws and plastic packaging – and let them know you want them to do better when they don’t.
     <li>Use reusable water bottles, coffee mugs, and bags. Some retailers will even give you a discount for doing so!</li>
     <li>If you forget your reusable coffee mug at a coffee shop, ask to have your coffee “for here” in a real mug and drink it there. Many coffee shops have ceramic mugs for customers, but they only use them upon request.</li>
     <li>Tell your local supermarket that you won’t buy produce wrapped in plastic. Purchase loose fruits and vegetables or shop at the farmers market.</li>
     <li>Bring your own glass container or mesh baggies and buy grains, nuts, and other items in the bulk section.</li>
     <li>Avoid items wrapped in excess plastic.</li>
     <li>Replace plastic items at home with alternatives made from natural materials (bamboo toothbrushes, glass jars, wooden toys).</li>
      <li>Whenever you see plastic in nature, collect it and recycle it if possible or put it in the trash can.</li>
      <li>Talk trash with your friends, family, and colleagues! Share this website with them and show them photos and videos about plastic pollution on social media to help spread awareness about this global problem.</li>

The charity want to change the world’s attitude towards plastic and seek to educate and engage everyone to rethink plastic through an awareness campaign using film and media. They encourage people to share their powerful documentary A Plastic Ocean (see trailer from our previous blog post here) with communities, schools, friends and family.
