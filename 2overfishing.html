    <h1 class="title"> About Overfishing </h1>
    <p class="paragraph">According to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, the number of overfished stocks has tripled in the last half-century, and one-third of the world's assessed fisheries are now pushed beyond their biological limits. Bycatch—the capture of unwanted sea life while fishing for a different species—is closely linked to overfishing. This is also a serious marine threat that results in the unnecessarily death of billions of fish, as well as hundreds of thousands of sea turtles and cetaceans.</p>

    <h2 class="title"> Effects of Overfishing </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Decades of destructive fishing has resulted in the precipitous decline of key fish stocks such as bluefin tuna and Grand Banks cod, as well as collateral impacts to other marine life. Hundreds of thousands of marine mammals, seabirds, and sea turtles are captured each year, alongside tens of millions of sharks. Many of these species are endangered and protected, while some such as the vaquita, Eastern Pacific leatherback turtle, and Maui dolphin are on the brink of extinction. The damage done by overfishing goes beyond the marine environment. Billions of people rely on fish for protein, and fishing is the principal livelihood for millions of people around the world. Many people who make a living catching, selling, and buying fish are working to improve how the world manages and conserves ocean resources. <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/" target="_blank">WWF</a> works with a cross-section of stakeholders to reform fisheries management globally, focusing on sustainable practices that not only conserve ecosystems, but also sustain livelihoods and ensure food security. </p>

    <h2 class="title"> Solutions </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">The world’s oceans are so big we thought for a long time that there was nothing humans could do to hurt them. Now we’re facing an imminent and global collapse of our fisheries, projected to happen as early as 2048, thanks to overfishing, wasteful fishing practices and massive overconsumption. But, there are a few key tried-and-tested solutions to overfishing that have been successfully implemented around the world. The trick is to scale these solutions up to a global scale, encouraging countries that have originally been resistant to helping and get them onboard, and supporting countries that don’t have the means to update their fishing policies themselves. </p>
    <ul>Here are some thing you can push for in your country:</ul>
    <li>Create more marine protected areas</li>
    <li>Stop trawling</li>
    <li>Worldwide Catch Shares</li>
    <li>Educate everyone and spread the word</li>
    <li>Join a campaign and support organizations</li>
    <li>Only eat sustainable seafood</li>

        <p class="paragraph">Greenpeace was founded in 1971 by environmental activists .With offices in over 40 countires, they are an international environmental organisation with a goal to “ensure the ability of the Earth to nurture life in all its diversity”. Their campaigns are mainly focused on global warming, deforestation and overfishing. Greenpeace are also fighting strong in the war on plastic and are calling on governements to act. They are encouraging us to all act together by creating closed loop systems that will allow us to reudce and reuse materials rather than them becoming waste pollution. They are urging if we take action now we can protect the world’s oceans for future generations. At this moment Greenpeace are calling on Coca Cola to reduce their plastic footprint - this takes effort, time and funding. Greenpeace are also currently calling for a UK plastic bottle deposit return scheme - you can sign to show your support. The organisation does not accept funding from governments, corporations or policital parties yet rely on the loyal 2.9million individual supporters. People like you. Visit the website to see how you can donate and support.</p>

        <p>Their project goals:</p> 
        <ul class="paragraph"> <em>"To support effective implementation of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy, we worked with decision-makers in the EU and the United Kingdom to advocate for:</ul>

<li>Fishing limits to be set at sustainable levels that allow stocks to recover.</li>
<li>Long-term legislation that would achieve the objectives of the CFP in each region.</li>
<li>Implementation of the CFP’s bycatch reforms, including the EU’s Landing Obligation.</li>
<li>Clear and public reporting on progress toward these aims.</li>
<li>A post-Brexit joint EU-UK management framework to allow the recovery of fish populations to sustainable levels."</li></em>
