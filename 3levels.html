    <h1 class="title"> About Rising Sea Levels </h1>
    <p class="paragraph">Sea-level rise may be the most well-known of all the effects of climate change, probably due to its popularity in TV shows, movies, and social media in general; but what does it all mean? Our seas will continue to rise as our planet warms. That's because climate change is the leading cause of sea-level rise. Here's how it works: As we burn fossil fuels, we release an increasing amount of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide) into the atmosphere. These gases act like a blanket, trapping heat (thus the name "greenhouse effect") and causing our planet to heat up.</p>

    <h2 class="title"> Effects of Rising Sea Levels </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Beach erosion, delta inundation, floods, and the loss of numerous marshes and wetlands are the main physical repercussions of rising sea levels. Increased salinity in coastal aquifers and estuary systems will very certainly become a problem because of saltwater intrusion. As a result, salty and freshwater bodies of water  will  certainly collide, endangering millions of freshwater and saltwater life. We are putting not only the water in jeopardy, but also ourselves. Eight of the world's top 10 cities are located near a coastline. As sea levels rise, millions of people around the world will be affected by increased coastal flooding and erosion, as well as stronger storm surges pushing deeper inland. We’re not talking about something happening in 10 years. We’re talking about something happening right now – and unless we act, the danger will only grow.</p>

    <h2 class="title"> Solutions </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">As stated before, we discharge an increasing amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as we burn fossil fuels. These gases behave as a blanket, trapping heat and which results in climate change. To stop the alarming rate our planet is heating up, simply deplete the use of fossil fuels; but it's not as easy as it sounds. Big corporations are the ones releasing these harmful gases and have no signs of stopping; but with enough cooperation we can make a change.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Divest from the use of Fossil Fuels and use renewable energy. Try your best and limit yourself from using unnecessary energy. Save it.</li>
        <li> Boycott companies that are not sustainable and contribute a lot of carbon emissions and instead opt out and go for many of the eco friendly companies.</li>
        <li>Plant vegetation/protect and respect existing greenery.</li>
      </ul>

        <p class="paragraph">"The Sea-Level Rise Foundation aims to provide a mechanism for leveraging global attention on the impacts of climate change on small island states and other low-lying areas. The Sea Level Rise Foundation is registered as a non-profit organization based in Seychelles with an international board of trustees.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Our mission is to bring about a more focussed effort for adaptation to sea-level rise."</p>
        <a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/sea-level_rise/" target="_blank">biologicaldiversity.org</a>
        <p>"A groundbreaking report from the Center finds that 233 threatened and endangered species in 23 coastal states are at risk from sea-level rise...The Center has been taking action to protect wildlife from the impacts of sea-level rise for years — through our work to curb the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change, the root of the problem, and protecting vulnerable coastal species and their habitats under the Endangered Species Act. We’re also working to make sure our wildlife agencies protect upland habitat for endangered species living along the coast so that they have places to move in the face of rising seas.</p> 
        <a href="http://miamisearise.com/shop-donate/" target="_blank">miamisearise.com</a>
        <p>"Our mission is to educate everyone about Sea Level Rise and we need your help today. The Sink or Swim initiative visits local schools, businesses and civic groups to educate as many people as possible about the science of sea level rise and the very real risks that our region faces. Your donations and sponsorship helps us cover the costs of travel, the publication of our Comic & Adventure Books as well as our ever popular polar bear toy handouts. Any amount, no matter how small or large, is appreciated and useful to helping us educate. For your donation and consideration, thank you."</p>
